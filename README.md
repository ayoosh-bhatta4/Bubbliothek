# Bubbliothek
A journal analyst. 

# The goal of this project is making a mobile application which can:
1. Take input from the user. The input is data which has two parts. "what" the user does, thinks or feels at a specific time. "category" of the said "what". This input is called a "bubble". So, each bubble encapsulates two things: entry, and its category.
2. Use these categories to show meaningful connections between this data. Goal is to show a "correlation" between two bubbles. These correlations arre supposed to be made from timing and frequency of these bubbles. If they have a "50%" match, then what that actually means is that the product of two indices which track the similarities of frequency and timing of the two bubbles are at half of maximum value.
3. I plan to be able to show these relations pictorically. For that graphical views will have to be generated from these relational views of multiple bubbles.
4. We can easily integrate AI into this project
5. As we will be handling large amount of sensitive data of users, it would be essential to establish security.

# This project is made with the intention of submitting to DBMS sir at this moment. For that there are some conditions.
1. Project has to be completed before the end of diwali break that is 1st week of november.
2. Problem statement must be provided
3. ER Model/ Relational model
4. Integrety constraints provided
5. Suitable queries to create and manage database.

# What will we do?
1. First of all we have to be clear of the database aspects of the project. Creating a schema in ER model for relationship between different bubbles. Then decide what we will actually extract from the input to arrive eventually at our coefficients. Then decide the integrity constraints etc to basically satisfy whatever is being asked from DBMS project POV.
2. Then we will actually implement our appplication. We have to do this modularly. Note that only the points 1 and 2 must be done in order to give a presentable project to DBMS. UI/UX has to be developed for that though.
